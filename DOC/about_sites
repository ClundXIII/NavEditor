Frontend Structure:
@author Simon Michalke

general:
  a) Seperate .css, .js files and the php classes completly
  d) all .css files are in the fe_css subfolder, all .js files in the fe_js subfolder, etc

Where a site is split in:
<site-class>.php =: file name


1) in index.php the doctype, header, etc is included.
2) theres a <site-class> => "Page Title" array in config.php to create the page title (maybe create a seperate site_config ...)
3) index.php includes fe_json/<site-class>.json.php if there is one.
4) index.php runs includeFE("<site-class"); which means "include Front End" --> this includes the old includeHTML function and the new .js files INLINE in NavTools ///TODO we really need a site-config.php!!!
5) index.php includes <site-name>.php which just contains the stuff between header and footer
6) index.php includes the footer
7) magic.
